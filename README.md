# web-scraping
this repository is created for learner who wants to learn web scraping. I have also done two assignments with the code which will lead to more clear understanding of the learners. 

when a program or script pretend to be a browser and retrieves wed pages, looks at those web pages, extracts information, and then looks at more web pages.
we also call this "spidering the web" or "web crawling.

#why scrape
1) pull data-particularly social data - who links to who?
2) get your own data back out of some system that has no "expert capability".
3) moniter a site for new information.
4) spider the web to make a database for a search engine.


I have used BeautifulSoup liberary for web scraping. BeautifulSoup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
